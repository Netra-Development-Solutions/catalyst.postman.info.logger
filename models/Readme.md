# LogInfo Schema Documentation

This document provides an overview of the `LogInfoSchema` used in the application. The schema defines the structure of log entries stored in the MongoDB collection.

## Schema Fields

### logType
- **Type**: `String`
- **Required**: `true`
- Represents the type of log entry (e.g., error, warning, info).

### logMessage
- **Type**: `String`
- **Required**: `true`
- Holds the primary message or content of the log entry.

### logDetails
- **Type**: `String`
- **Required**: Optional
- Can hold additional details or context about the log entry.

### logLevel
- **Type**: `String`
- **Required**: `true`
- Indicates the severity level of the log entry (e.g., debug, info, warning, error).

### logSource
- **Type**: `String`
- **Required**: `true`
- Represents the source of the log entry (e.g., a specific component, service, or module).

### logUser
- **Type**: `String`
- **Required**: `true`
- **Reference**: `'User'`
- Reference to a user document from another collection (e.g., `'User'`). Indicates which user is associated with the log entry.

### logEnv
- **Type**: `String`
- **Required**: `true`
- Represents the environment where the log entry was generated (e.g., production, staging, development).

### logApp
- **Type**: `String`

### transactionId
- **Type**: `String`
- **Required**: Optional

## Additional Features

- The schema includes the `timestamps` option, which automatically adds `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields to the documents, storing the timestamps of document creation and last update, respectively.

## Exported Model

The schema is exported as a Mongoose model called `'LogInfo'`, making it ready for use in other parts of the application.
